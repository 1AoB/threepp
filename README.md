## threepp (Work in progress)

C++ port of the popular Javascript 3D library [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) [r129](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r129).


#### Current state of the project

Most of the core library has been ported, but some vital parts of the rendering pipeline has yet to be completed.
Thus, threepp is not yet in a functional state. 

### But, but why?

This is mostly a personal exercise. Don't expect any support, although contributions are welcome.
